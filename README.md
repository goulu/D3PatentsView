# D3PatentsView
Visualization of US Patents with D3js as a "force graph" where:
* X axis is constrained to the patent's date
* Edges show cited/cited by relationship
* Colors identify  assignee organizations (companies)
* Hoovering a node shows information about the patent
* Single click on a node "highlights" it and its direct neighbors [(thanks)](http://www.coppelia.io/2014/07/an-a-to-z-of-extra-features-for-the-d3-force-layout/)
* Double click opens the patent's page in Google Patent
